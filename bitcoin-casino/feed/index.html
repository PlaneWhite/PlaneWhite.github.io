				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #808080;"><strong>Winz.io Casino Review &#8211; BitGamble<br />
</strong></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></h2>
<p><a href="https://winzmedia.top/a9a56d9ec">Winz.io</a> is a fresh online casino, that accepts both Fiat and cryptocurrencies, in the recent months after their official they did a good job in attracting tens of thousands of users, thereby becoming a popular crypto-based gambling platform. The recently-founded casino operates out of Curacao, and provides users with a variety of games designed by top developers, alongside a series of cool welcome bonuses, responsive user interface, immersive gameplay, and multitude payment options. Mobile &amp; Desktop are both supported.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Games</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>• Popular Casino games</strong></p>
<p>Just like most other top-grossing online casinos, Winz.io has invested considerable resources into expanding its game catalogue. As such, any gambler can feel welcomed on this platform, as there are games that fit all tastes. To put this into perspective, users can find games developed by some of the market’s best casino software developers, such as NETENT, SoftSwiss, Microgaming, PlayTech, Play’n’Go, Evolution Gaming, iSoftBet, Amatic Industries, EvoPlay, and many more.</p>
<p>At this time, Winz casino’s top categories are slots, table games and live casino games. In terms of slots, users can easily access some of the best games the industry has to offer, including but not limited to Platinum Lightning, Deluxe Domnitors, Africa Gold, Dragon’s Pearl, Lucky 3 Streak, Deadwood, Disco Bar 7s, Mega Drago, Super Sevens, Piggy Bank, Diamond Vapor, etc. Those who are more interested in table games will be happy to know that Winz.io also provides blackjack, baccarat, European roulette, Vegas strip, and more.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Winz.io also offers a series of live casino games, where real dealers take their time to provide users with an immersive gambling experience. Multiple language support is offered, whereas the dealers are always fully-professional. Anonymity is also guaranteed. Some of the most popular live casino games that users can find on this platform include Speed Baccarat, VIP Roulette, White Blackjack, Mega Ball, Immersive Roulette, Japan Roulette, and more.</p>
<p><strong>• Bonuses</strong></p>
<p>Winz.io provides users with different bonus iterations, but in this part of the review, we will mostly concentrate on the welcome deposit bonus. With this in mind, new users can get access to three bonuses, for their first three deposits. As such, the 1st deposit will grant you a 100% match bonus (up to 1 BTC), the 2nd deposit will provide a 50% match bonus (up to 2 BTC), whereas the 3rd and final bonus will grant users 50% match bonus (up to 3BTC).

<p><strong>• Deposits &amp; withdrawals</strong></p>
<p>Winz.io was designed to deliver an improved online gambling experience that’s available worldwide. Thus, this international support is possible through a fully-fledged support of multiple currencies. To keep things simple, deposits and withdrawals and can be made via cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin, ethereum, Litecoin, bitcoin cash, and dogecoin), whereas traditional fiat-based payment methods are also supported. The list includes Visa, MasterCard, Maestro, Skrill, iDebit, PaySafeCard, Neteller, Mobile Commerce, and more. Some withdrawals and deposits are limited to a minimum sum, whereas some payment methods might entail an extra fee. Worry not, as these fees are minimal, and are not designed to profit the casino.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #666699;"><strong>Winz.io Review Analysis</strong></span></p>
<p>While Winz.io is still a fairly-new platform, it has managed to attract a large number of users, thus making it one of the top-grossing casinos on the market. This achievement is mostly due to the platform’s large catalogue of games, multiple payment option support, great customer service team, professional live casino dealers, and well-designed user interface.</p>
<p>Similarly, users can rest assured that their payments are secure, whereas the casino complies with all market regulations, thus providing users with a fair experience.<br />
Of course, there is still room for improvement, as achieving fully-immersive gambling takes a lot of work.</p>
<p>Winz.io uses SSL encryption in it&#8217;s communication routes which adds an extra layer of protection that shields player&#8217;s sensitive information from being spied on, in addition to supporting 2FA authentication and Phone Verification.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>BitGamble &#8211; PeerGame Review<br />
</strong></h2>
<h2><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Overview:</strong></span></h2>
<p>PeerGame is a novel casino built uniquely on the BSV blockchain, it supports only BSV as a cryptocurrency.  PeerGame looks simple but near, their interface is clear and filled with original games that are 100% provably fair. All Deposits are handled by moneybutton, a payment gateway for BSV.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>*N.B: IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SAVE YOUR RECOVERY PHRASE WHEN CREATING A MONEYBUTTON ACCOUNT*</strong></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Games:</strong></span></h2>
<p>PeerGame initially started with a few games, and upped the number to a total of 4 original games ( with DICE coming soon) that look great and are unique to the platform.</p>
<p>The most important aspect of that platform is that it only hosts 100% provably fair  games, a great addition that allows players to prove and verify that their results are fair and un-manipulated, which completely eradicates any trust issues.</p>
<p>Games that are currently playable:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Bitto: </strong></span>Lottery type game that is 100%  provably fair, meaning that user can manually verify each draw. Players can play this game by simply buying a ticket, currently priced at 0.01 BSV. The more tickets a player has, the higher the chances of winning. Up to 4 players can win each draw with the 1st player getting the biggest share of the prize. Every 16 hours a new draw is generated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Turtle Race: </strong></span>Fun virtual race game, where a player bets on a turtle (red, blue or yellow), the winning bet earns x2.94 of their initial stake, each turtle race starts every 2 minutes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Ladder: </strong></span>Another fun game that is similar to the turtle race in concept, where a player picks a ladder (left or right) and the winning bet earns x1.96 of their initial stake, each round starts at every 1 min.</li>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Baccarat:</strong></span> The Classic Baccarat game, set in a smooth interface unique to PeerGame, it uses the HashChain algorithm to randomize all events.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All TxID&#8217;s of any game can be publicly inspected and verified, and you can check your stats history, bets placed, leaderboard, and other historical data.</p>
<p>PeerGame does not currently have any specific loyalty program, however they do run interesting promotional offers, where you get to earn daily BSV for free or other interesting quests that reward completion.</p>
<p>BSV deposits are ultra fast and can only be made through moneybutton (more wallets to be added soon) since no registration is required. Your Winnings are paid instantly back to your wallet, delays might depend on the network</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #666699;">PeerGame Review Analysis:</span><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>PeerGame is a unique mini casino that is built entirely on the BSV blockchain, all of their games are provably fair which greatly enhances trust with its players. A great feature of this platform is that no registration is required to fully enjoy all of their games, they greatly respect their user&#8217;s privacy and anonimty! We also love the fact that it is fast paced, and deposits/withdrawals are made directly from/to your wallet.</p>
<p>The team behind PeerGame have been consistent in adding new features and already plan the release of new decentralized/provably fair games, taking into consideration that they are still very fresh in their launch, as per their support team the license for this platform is in progress.</p>
<p>Customer support quality is  decent, we have tested their live chat system and the operators are fast to reply to your queries, you can also reach their support via <a href="https://t.me/peergame">telegram</a> &amp; <a href="https://discord.gg/cH4jbGS">discord</a></p>
<p>According to third party traffic analytics the platform receives a low amount of visitors per month, estimated between <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class="e24Kjd">~</span></span>12,000 -17,000 which makes the casino&#8217;s turnover rate low, it is unsure how they are able to handle huge winnings. The low traffic number does not have anything to do with its performance, they are still very early players in the market and have much to prove!</p>
<p>PeerGame uses SSL encryption in it&#8217;s communication routes which adds an extra layer of protection that shields player&#8217;s sensitive information from being spied on, your account is very safe since there are no credentials to use, however it is extremely important to backup your wallet!</p>

Mobile version is supported, both iOS and Android.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Games:</strong></span></h2>
<p>BC Game has a few selection of 8 crypto games with original themse that are available on their platform, you can play:</p>
<ul>

<li style="text-align: left;">SLOTS</li>
</ul>
<p>Keno and Baccarat are two upcoming additions that will be available soon. What differentiates BC Game casino from other crypto casinos is the fact that all of their games are open source and most importantly 100% provably fair, a system which allows players to verify each roll greatly eliminating the possibilities of being  cheated by the house, and ensuring fairness  between the casino and their players. Every single transaction can be tracked, meaning that every player&#8217;s move, stats and history can be checked publicly which provides a fully transparent environment.</p>

<p>BC Game is one of the first crypto casinos to integrate with the Lightning Network which allows instant deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 18pt;"><strong>BC Game Casino Analysis</strong></span></p>
<p>BC Game is an exceptional crypto casino, the management team  are crypto enthusiasts whom are dedicated to position BC Game to become the top industry, they are much more crypto friendly than many other bitcoin casinos that we have reviewed, what we like mostly about this platform is that is purely blockchain based and is designed to scale, it is provably fair, has its own custom games and is one of the first to use the lightning network for its BTC deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>According to third party traffic analytics the platform receives a high amount of visitors per month, estimated between <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn c3biWd"><span class="e24Kjd">~</span></span>1,800,000 -2,000,000 which makes the casino&#8217;s turnover rate great, and should a player make a big winning, it should not have any issue with doing its due diligence without any delay.</p>
<p>BC.Game is accredited by the Crypto Gambling foundation, which is a reputable crypto organization that ensures fair gambling operations, however not much is known behind the group that is operating BC Game or any official license. There were no evidence of any major complaints or malpractice from BC Game, as far as our research went, please write in the discussion if have you have ever experienced any bad service.</p>
<p>BC Game uses SSL encryption in it&#8217;s communication routes which adds an extra layer of protection. The support of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies makes deposits and withdrawals even safer since they are encrypted and do not pass through any third party. The platform adds another layer of security by supporting 2FA and extra passwords on withdrawals which is highly recommended to enable both since they protect your account from being compromised even if the hacker has your private login information.</p>
<p>The support on Live Chat is &#8220;okay&#8221; on response time based on recurrent tests that we made, if you seek support it is best to reach their <a href="https://discord.gg/7ENBXxZ">discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/L5YyYla7--Arsls3DgAgdw">telegram</a> or other socials. They also have a dedicated Forum on their website where most users hang out to chat and help each others out. You can also check their <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5088875.0">BitcoinTalk</a> Thread for deeper info regarding the team.</p>

<p>1xBIT has been around since 2007 but it was in 2016 where the platform decided to rebrand itself into a crypto gambling platform.  however it could have done a much better job in managing its online reputation. According to third party traffic analytics the platform receives a high amount of visitors per month, estimated between 1,700,000 – 2,500,000 a month [Last Checked 14.3.2019], its years in the industry and fair amount of visitors should theoretically not cause any problems with handling big prize winnings.</p>
<p>Our research has found some complaints and some negative user feedback regarding 1xBIT Casino, which is an important factor to consider prior investing with your own bitcoin, or at least invest with small sums.</p>
<p>Customer support is decent, we tested their live chat feature for a week by asking noobish and some annoying questions to test their flexibility, response time and support quality was good.</p>
<p>1xBit had a thread on <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3906360.0">BitCoinTalk</a>, however it is flagged with a warning due to some reports claiming fraudulent actions from the the thread opener.</p>
<p>1xBIT uses SSL encryption in it’s communication routes which adds an extra layer of protection that shields player’s sensitive information from being spied on. The support of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies makes deposits and withdrawals even safer since they are encrypted and do not pass through any third party. The support of 2FA adds another layer of security, it is always recommended to enable 2FA especially if you are betting with large sums.</p>
<p><strong>It is important to read the <a href="https://1xbit.com/en/information/rules/">terms and conditions</a> of any bitcoin casino prior making the decision of using their platforms, always bet responsibly!</strong></p>
