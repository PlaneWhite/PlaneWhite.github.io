				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #999999;">How to Uniswap </span><br />
What is Uniswap?</strong></span></p>
<p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange that is built on the Ethereum Blockchain, it allows buyers and sellers to instantly swap ERC20 tokens through the use of smart contracts. What makes Uniswap revolutionary in the crypto space is the fact that it allows anyone to instantly trade, provide liquidity or launch their own token. It is a decentralized exchange that is aimed towards the cryptocurrency community, there are no middlemen and you can trade instantly from your web3 wallet. You can also generate commission in the form of exchange fees by providing liquidity to any trading pair of your choice.</p>
<p>In order to provide liquidity, you need to add a 50/50 ratio of both trading pairs, meaning 50% of ETH and 50% of the selected ERC20 token.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLE2DG0mrd0" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>Benefits/Advantages of Uniswap</strong></span></p>
<p>The beauty of using a decentralized exchange such as Uniswap is that you do not have to worry of the exchange getting hacked, high fees or any mismanagement incident from the staff. Transactions are made directly from your own wallet, without creating an account or have your sensitive information stored in any database.<br />
Uniswap is public and open source, it is 100% on-chain meaning that it does not require any third party tool to operate. Unlike traditional decentralized exchanges or even centralized exchanges, Uniswap does not operate by using an Order book, where buyers and sellers are the liquidity providers, it instead uses an Automated Market Maker model, where users deposit liquidity in the form of a smart contract and a fine tuned algorithm take cares of the price action. In return the exchange rewards liquidity providers by giving contributing users a comission % of the <a href="https://hackmd.io/@HaydenAdams/HJ9jLsfTz?type=view#Fee-Structure">fees</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>How to use Uniswap?</strong></span></p>
<p>First you need to download a web3 wallet, the most popular wallet is <a href="https://metamask.io/">metamask</a> which is a browser based wallet in which you can use to connect to Uniswap. The main frontend interface is pretty simple, you first connect you wallet, and you will be able to swap any ERC20 token that  is available in your wallet.<br />
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Note: Some ERC20 tokens do not appear in the list, you may have to manually insert the contract address so that you will be able to swap. it is EXTREMELY important that you make sure that you have the right contract address of the token that you plan to buy, always double check that information by visiting the discord/telegram of the selected token, they will always post the correct address.</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-884 size-full" src="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/interfaceewew.jpg" alt="how to uniswap" width="1120" height="717" srcset="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/interfaceewew.jpg 1120w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/interfaceewew-300x192.jpg 300w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/interfaceewew-768x492.jpg 768w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/interfaceewew-1024x656.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1120px) 100vw, 1120px" /></p>
<p>There are multiple third party Uniswap explorers that you may take advantage of, the most popular ones being:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/">DexTools</a> (If you hold $DEXT you will have access to more advanced features)</li>
<li><a href="https://uniswap.info/">Uniswap.info</a></li>
<li><a href="http://unicrypt.network/">Unicrypt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The best charting tool that you can use on uniswap coins, is chartex. To use chartex, you just have to take this <a href="https://www.chartex.pro/?symbol=UNISWAP:">URL</a> and modify the ticker. For example if  you want to chart a coin called $YELD, the URL will look like this: https://www.chartex.pro/?symbol=UNISWAP:<strong><span style="color: #ffcc00;">YELD</span></strong></p>
<p>Uniswap coins are high risk/high reward, some may turn out to be complete scams and others may moon and do a 10x+. Always #DYOR and always invest with what you can afford to lose</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note: For each transaction that you make on Uniswap, you incur Gas Fees, gas can be expensive, you can use etherscan&#8217;s <a href="https://etherscan.io/gastracker">gas tracker</a> or <a href="http://ethgasstation.info/">ethgasstation</a> to get an idea on the price of gas. You sometimes have to &#8216;approve&#8217; a smart contract before being able to swap it, which also incurs additional gas fees.<br />

There are multiple crypto casinos that have bitcoin blackjack, it is a bit disappointing to come across a casino that does not have black in their game selection. Bitcoin &amp; Gambling go hand in hand, as opposed to traditional online casinos, bitcoin has allowed casino players to enjoy a better experience when playing blackjack by taking advantage of fast deposits/withdrawals and without providing any personal information or any intrusive data to casino owners.

<h2><span style="color: #666699;">How to Play Bitcoin Blackjack ?</span></h2>
<p>The first step is to sign-up on a casino of your choice, you can sign up to any reputable casino from the list above. After you deposit your BTC, and depending on the casino, you should be able to easily navigate the interface and find the blackjack game.  If you are looking for the live blackjack game it is always found in the live games section.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-629 size-full" src="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blackhjack.jpg" alt="bitcoin blackjack" width="1201" height="678" srcset="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blackhjack.jpg 1201w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blackhjack-300x169.jpg 300w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blackhjack-768x434.jpg 768w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/blackhjack-1024x578.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></p>
<p>If you are totally new to Blackjack or you have no idea on how to play the game, it is not advisable to directly jump straight to the action. You need to familiarize yourself with the game, there are multiple guides found online that will help you grasp the concept if you are a <a href="https://www.888casino.com/blog/blackjack-strategy-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">total beginner</a>, or learn advanced strategies if you are looking to up your game, blackjack is a fun game that can grant you good returns, since it is kind of the only game where the odds shift from house to player in terms of favor, if you have  solid mathematical skills this can give you a slight advantage as well.   However it is important to note that luck is always a factor to consider no matter how good you are at this game, never bet with more than you can afford to lose.</p>
<p>If Blackjack is not your type of card game, you can also check our list of the best <a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-poker-sites/">bitcoin poker sites</a>,  that accept bitcoin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="color: #808080;">Ethereum Casino List 2020<br />
</span></h1>
<p>Ethereum is without doubt second in command after Bitcoin when it comes to cryptocurrencies, and we wouldn&#8217;t even be surprised if it surpasses BTC at one point in history since it is much more than a currency or a store of value, since it allows anyone to build decentralized apps by leveraging its technology. Most alt coins that are available on the market are ERC-20 tokens, or in simpler terms, tokens that run on the Ethereum Blockchain.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we are going to list our handpicked Ethereum casino list, split into three <a href="https://www.publish0x.com/bitcoin-gambling-crypto-casino/best-bitcoin-casino-which-one-is-it-xolklzo">casino categories</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Casino List:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/bit-starz-review-bitcoin-casino-101/">BitStarz</a> &#8211; BitStarz is no doubt, a casino of quality, it also supports Ethereum on both deposits and withdrawals which makes it a must add to our ethereum casino list<br />
There are no deposit bonuses directly related to Ethereum, however you do benefit from free spins and other bonuses if you use ETH as your wagering currency.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/melbet-casino-review/">Melbet </a>&#8211; MelBet is a good option for those who are are more into sports betting rather than gambling.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/bitcoin-casino-101-cloudbet-review/">CloudBet </a>&#8211; For long Cloudbet was only limited to BTC and BCH, however in the recent months Cloudbet has introduced Ethereum !</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto Casino List:</strong></p>
<p>Most Crypto Casinos have support ethereum, however it is worth listing the ones that we think are top in the industry:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/bitcoin-casino-reviews-stake-review/">Stake</a> &#8211; Stake is the type of casino that only gets better time, lots of new crypto games and casino games were added in their latest update.</li>
<li><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/crypto-games-review-bitcoin-casino/">Crypto-Games</a>: Crypto-Games is a classic crypto casino that accepts Ethereum, do not be discouraged by the simple interface, all games that are hosted on Crypto games are 100% provably fair, and when it comes to transparency it is always an advantage if compared how the platform visually looks like.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Decentralized Casino List:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/earnbet-casino/">Earnbet</a> &#8211; Earnbet is a novel decentralized casino that is ETH friendly, it is one of the few online casinos that is pure decentralized.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3><span style="color: #666699;">No Deposit Bonus Ethereum Casinos</span></h3>
<p>No deposit bonus ethereum casinos are quite rare, and most use it as a marketing strategy rather an an actual bonus since there might be either very strict requirements, country restrictions or other terms. Most no deposit bonuses come in the form of free spins, where the online casino rewards you when signing up with a number of free spins that you can use that are limited to certain slot machines.</p>
<p>Bitstarz is one of the few ethereum casinos that offers free spins on your first deposit, and might also offer a no deposit free spins bonus, however make sure to validate it with support upon registration.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-casino/mbit-casino-reviews/">MBit</a> is another ethereum casino that might credit you with a free spins, no deposit bonus.</p>
<p>Always make sure to check or ask support for the terms and conditions regarding your no deposit bonus, since some might have unusual wagering requirements.</p>
<p>Nevertheless free spins add great value to any casino that allows it, and might easily encourage players to deposit real funds and gain loyalty to the platform.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Ethereum Casino Games</strong></span></h3>
<p>You will find lots of Ethereum supported games in the casino list above, you can enjoy most casino games with Ethereum such as Blackjack, slots, roulette and sports betting to name a few. The only thing that is missing from this list is ethereum poker games which will be covered soon on Bitgamble since so far we have reviewed only <a href="https://bitgamble.org/bitcoin-poker-sites/">bitcoin poker sites. </a></p>
<h3><span style="color: #666699;">Ethereum Casino Summary</span></h3>
<p>The Ethereum casino cyberspace is expected to expand due to the many advantages it has over fiat and even bitcoin. It is expected that more and more decentralized casinos will take advantage of Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain in the near future.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #666699;">Bitcoin Poker Sites:</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin is largely dominating the casino industry mostly since it provides much needed solutions that were not possible to accomplish with normal fiat currencies, however it is still unsure why the bitcoin poker industry  i<span class="ILfuVd"><span class="e24Kjd">s still dwarfed by traditional online poker sites, it might be attributed to the fact that there are not many reputable bitcoin poker sites or that hardcore poker players are comfortable with using traditional fiat currencies are not open to gambling with non-fiat alternatives.  In this article you will explore the pros of bitcoin poker, and a list of a few reputable bitcoin poker sites that we have reviewerd, and might be of interest for crypto gamblers that are into poker but cannot trust trying a random poker website due to the large amount of poker scam platforms that are available online.</span></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #666699;">The Advantages of Bitcoin Poker</span></h2>
<p>One of the major advantages that bitcoin poker brings to the table, is the convenience of use, you do not have to verify yourself by ongoing through any tiresome KYC process, or be bothered by the fact that your favorite third party payment provider, such as paypal for example is not available, or even share the risk of exposing your credit card details in case of a breach or other mishap. All you need is a private wallet and some BTC in it, then you can safely deposit your coins and get straight into the action.</p>
<p>Anonymity and fast transactions is another great advantage that bitcoin poker websites offer since there isn&#8217;t any third party payment process between you and the platform, you are your own bank.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-471" title="Bitcoin Poker Sites" src="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bitcoin-Poker-Sites-1024x768.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Poker Sites" width="494" height="370" srcset="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bitcoin-Poker-Sites.jpg 1024w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bitcoin-Poker-Sites-300x225.jpg 300w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bitcoin-Poker-Sites-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" /></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized">You benefit also from minimal transaction fee, where in most cases the only withdrawal fees that you have to worry about are the miner fees which are too negligent to count. Withdrawals are most of the times processed within 24/48 hours sometimes just within hours, and most importantly withdrawals do not need to undergo long delays for approval and for payment processing, it is all made possible thanks to blockchain technology.</figure>
</div>
<p>Bonuses are another thing to take into consideration, websites such as <a href="https://bitgamble.org/program/realpoker-net-review/">realpoker</a> offer you a generous <span class="DFlfde SwHCTb" data-precision="4" data-value="0.001599066">~0.0016 BTC as a free signup bonus for you to test the platform and use in most tables.  </span></p>
<p>Since poker is frowned upon and might be considered an illegal activity in some countries, bitcoin poker sites made it possible to circumvent that restriction, however it is always best to check your local regulations and it&#8217;s legal stance regarding cryptocurrencies and online poker.</p>
<p>You can always use a <a href="https://www.expressvpn.com">VPN</a> to further protect your anonymity and enjoy your poker game.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>What are Provably Fair Games?</strong></span></p>
<p>You may have come across this term alot if you have been checking our <a href="https://bitgamble.org/program/">crypto casino</a> reviews. What are provably fair games, and why is it something that we prefer and encourage it?</p>
<p>Fairness &amp; online gambling go hand in hand, nothing ruins an online casino&#8217;s reputation more than it being accused to cheat or have a flawed algorithm that cheats its players.  Blockchain technology brought much transparency and immutability to the online casino industry, and made it possible to give birth to trustless casino games, where each roll can be manually verified by the player instead of relying on the casinos algorithm or third party gaming providers.</p>
<p>Crypto Casinos which implement a provably fair system are much more trustworthy and favor the ideology behind cryptocurrencies by eliminating any third party roll verification and give the power directly to its players, it simply leaves 0 possibility for the casino to cheat its users.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>How does it work?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are various techniques and modifications that crypto casinos use, however we will explain the most basic one;</p>
<ul>
<li>The server first creates an encrypted seed which you get before you start your game, since you get it prior your gambling session, the server cannot later change it.</li>
<li>Your browser generates a client seed which can be randomly generated or manually generated.</li>
<li>When the outcome occurs, the player receives the seed that was used in this bet.</li>
<li>The player can manually verify the bet and if there was any issue, the player would know.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Which Casinos implement Provably Fair Games?</strong></span></p>
<div class="explained-post-content__item"> Here is a list of some crypto casinos that implement games that are provably fair, the list is in no particular order:</div>

Ethereum Ethereum is a newer generation cryptocurrency that expands on the idea of Bitcoin, it was initially intended to complement rather to compete with it.  While it is blockchain based, decentralized and open source, what differs it from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the fact that it enables &#8216;smart contracts&#8217; [&#8230;]]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><span style="color: #808080;">Ethereum Gambling, What is Ether?</span><br />
</strong></span></h1>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong><br />
Ethereum</strong></span></p>
<p>Ethereum is a newer generation cryptocurrency that expands on the idea of Bitcoin, it was initially intended to complement rather to compete with it.  While it is blockchain based, decentralized and open source, what differs it from Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the fact that it enables &#8216;smart contracts&#8217; and it can also be used as a software to create decentralized apps (dAPPS).</p>
<p>Smart Contracts is just a fancy word to describe a digital contract between buyer and seller, what makes it special is that it cannot be manipulated, it is self-executing and does no require any third party to verify it. Anything of value can be exchanged with the use of smart contracts including property, digital goods, shares, legal terms, etc</p>
<p>Ethereum also has it&#8217;s own currency known as Ether (ETH) which is similar to how Bitcoin operates, currently it uses the POW (Proof of Work) algorithm and might switch to a POS (Proof of Stake) algorithm somewhere in the near future. ETH  uses a sub-currency known as GAS in order to be transacted.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Ethereum and Gambling</span></strong></p>
<p>Many crypto casinos offer ETH as a deposit/withdraw method, it is not a bad payment mechanism ETH transactions are faster than BTC. Ethereum Gambling is a good option for those who hope in increasing their Ethereum holding or simply prefer to use Ethereum.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>How to start with Ethereum</strong></span></p>
<p>Ethereum is a bit harder to grasp as opposed to Bitcoin but it is still not as complicated as its name sounds.</p>
<p>The first step is to download an ETH wallet which will take the role of your bank. There are many types of ETH wallets that you can use;</p>
<p><strong>Browser-Based wallet:</strong><a href="https://metamask.io/"> Metamask.io</a> is by far the best browser wallet, it is lightweight and embedded in your browser</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Wallet:</strong> <a href="https://www.exodus.io/">Exodus.io</a> is a good wallet to consider since it supports multi cryptocurrencies and it is easier to use than MetaMask</p>
<p>Once your wallet is setup, you need to buy ETH from a cryptocurrency exchange or you can also earn some Free Ethereum by completing <a href="https://bitgamble.org/free-bitcoin-faucet/">faucets</a>, do not expect to earn much but every little counts.</p>
<p>Using Ethereum on any crypto casino is pretty straightforward, you sign up, you choose <strong>ETH </strong>as your deposit method, and send ETH to the address. Transactions should be much faster when using Ethereum as opposed to Bitcoin.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>What is a Blockchain?</strong></span></p>
<p>Blockchain technology is a revolutionary concept, it is the main driving force behind Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies. In simple terms it consists of a list of records that are chained together using cryptography. Those records can take any form; a transaction, ownership, or any other form of data. What gives blockchain its magic and separates it from any other traditional database is that once a record is stored on the blockchain it cannot be altered, reversed or manipulated in any sort of way. Consensus protocols differ from one blockchain to another, but the core principles are similar, a record is only valid if the whole ecosystem agrees to it, whether it is direct or indirect.</p>
<p>There is a good reason why big corporations such as IBM, Microsoft and Facebook are rushing to adopt and implement blockchain technology.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Types of Blockchain</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em><em><strong>Public Blockchain:</strong> </em></em></span>A public blockchain is a permissionless system, it stems from the original vision of Bitcoin where anyone can join the blockchain and participate in its ecosystem. It is fully transparent, open source and decentralized. A perfect system for currencies since it is based on a trustless environment and self-governance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong><em><em><span style="color: #00ccff;">Private Blockchain:</span> </em></em></strong>A private blockchain is quite the opposite of a public blockchain, it is more focused on institutions or businesses since the owner of the blockchain is the validator and the one that governs user read/write access. In its true sense it is not decentralized, however private blockchains tend to be more scalable, faster but may be less secured.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;"><em>Hybrid Blockchain: </em></span></strong>A hybrid blockchain is a mix between a public and a private blockchain it benefits from the speed of private blockchains and security of public blockchains. It is semi-decentralized, and is also more focused on instutitions especially in the e-commerce sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li><strong><em><span style="color: #00ccff;">DAG</span>: </em></strong>DAG or Directed Acyclic graph is an experimental system that also uses a distributed ledger however transactions are not processed in a linear form similar to how blockchains work, instead they are processed in multiple directions, which in theory might make transactions much faster and feeless.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>Turning your BTC into Fiat:</strong></span></p>
<p>Owning BTC is equivalent to owning digital gold, a great store of value that is scarce and still has a long way to go. Since most of our daily transactions are dealt in Fiat, it makes sense to convert part of your BTC  to EUR\USD. Furthermore it is always smart to keep your funds diversified in many assets.</p>
<p>We will discuss one of the many options that a player can resort to, in case they want to withdraw their BTC to Fiat.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>Exchanges</strong></span></p>
<p>In order to convert your BTC to Fiat, you first need to create an account on an exchange. It is important to note that KYC is mandatory on most exchanges that allow BTC to Fiat conversion.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitstamp.net"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong><span style="color: #666699;">BitStamp</span></strong></em></span></a></p>
<p>BitStamp is a licensed Bitcoin exchange that is based in Luxembourg, while it focuses mainly on European countries, it does support the US. You can deposit BTC, XRP, BCash, Litecoin and Ethereum, which can be converted to USD or EUR. KYC is mandatory if you are thinking of using this exchange.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><a href="https://www.bitpanda.com"><em><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Bitpanda</span></strong></em></a></span></p>
<p>Bitpanda is a reputable and licensed cryptocurrency exchange that is based in Austria, it supports ALOT of different cryptocurrencies and is another popular choice for European players.  One of the drawbacks of this exchange is that it is not available worldwide and only EUR is supported. KYC is mandatory if you are thinking of using this exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinbase.com"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong><span style="color: #666699;">CoinBase</span></strong></em></span></a></p>
<p>Coinbase is one of the biggest licensed exchanges, it is very noob friendly and supports a good amount of cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, LTC, ZRX and BCH. Coinbase supports 55+ countries. KYC is mandatory if you are thinking of using this exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://gemini.com"><span style="color: #333399;"><em><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Gemini</span></strong></em></span></a></p>
<p>Gemini is another notable exchange that is licensed and puts alot of emphasis on security. You can deposit <span class="ILfuVd NA6bn"><span class="e24Kjd">BTC, ETH and US Dollars. KYC is mandatory if you are thinking of using this exchange.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><a href="https://paxful.com"><strong>Paxful</strong></a></span></p>
<p>Paxful is more of a marketplace than an exchange, where buyers meet sellers to trade BTC to fiat and vice versa. Trades are secured by escrow to limit fraud however fees are a bit higher compared to others. KYC is not mandatory for some sellers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699;"><a href="https://localbitcoins.com"><strong><span style="color: #666699;">LocalBitcoins</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>LocalBitcoins is the original Bitcoin marketplace, its services are worldwide and facilitates OTC trading of Fiat to BTC and vice versa. It is always a better idea to double check the seller that you are dealing with and make sure that they are not trying to scam and have many previous successful deals.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Bitcoin 101</strong></span></p>
<p>Bitcoin is a peer to peer decentralized digital currency that is not controlled by any central authority such as a bank or a financial intermediary. It is cryptographically secured, pseudonymous and fast to process.</p>
<p>Blockchain Technology is the backbone of Bitcoin, it is a distributed ledger that keeps track of each transaction made in an encrypted and immutable form. When a Bitcoin transaction is verified, it is instantly as a permanent record on the blockchain.  Bitcoin miners are main engines of the blockchain, they share the role of audits. Miners are the ones that confirm secure the transactions, under a process known as &#8216;Proof of Work&#8217; where they solve complex computational math in order to add the transaction on the blockchain, they earn rewards in return which are the miners fee that you pay.</p>
<p>What makes this ecosystem captivating, the fact that Blockchain is based on pure mathematics and it is designed in a way where it cannot be manipulated, data on the blockchain cannot be changed which makes Bitcoin an effective digital currency.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Bitcoin and Gambling</strong></span></p>
<p>It is no surprise that the online gambling industry fully embraces Bitcoin, it is a perfect payment mechanism that adds great value to online gamblers by offering the perks of fast deposits and withdrawals, more security and some degree of anonymity. What makes Bitcoin effective in online gambling is its divsibility. The smallest unit in Bitcoin is called a satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) which enable micro-transactions that traditional payment methods cannot achieve.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How to start with Bitcoin</strong></span></p>
<p>You do not need to have any technical skills to grasp the basics of using Bitcoin in online casinos.</p>
<p>The first step is to download a bitcoin wallet which will take the role of your own bank. There are many types of Bitcoin wallets that you can use, but for the sake of simplicity we&#8217;ll only discuss Desktop Wallets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download <a href="https://www.exodus.io/">Exodus</a> or <a href="https://electrum.org/#download">Electrum,</a> both are decent wallets that have Bitcoin and lots of other altcoins</li>
</ul>
<p>After installing your BTC wallet, the first step is to take note of your wallet seed, back it up and password protect your wallet. It is very important to know the difference between a private and a public key. Your Private Key is the most important piece of data needed, it should always be kept safe and never shared with anyone but yourself. Your bitcoin are yours simply because you have access to the  private key, if you lose your private key you lose all of your BTC which is impossible to recover. Your public key is your <span style="color: #00ffff;">public address</span> <em>(ex: 1EoPveFUfyKSACdnT94YVGfUKgNRmJ6y6e</em>) that you will use to send or receive btc to.</p>
<p>After you&#8217;re set up you need to buy Bitcoin and store it in your wallet. You can buy BTC with a credit card from <a href="https://localbitcoins.com/">LocalBitcoins,</a> <a href="https://Binance.com/">Binance,</a> <a href="https://paybis.com/">Paybis,</a> <a href="https://cryptopay.me">CryptoPay.</a> Bitstamp is a good option as well to consider if you&#8217;re looking to buy Bitcoin in big amounts, it is important to note that KYC is obligatory. After you receive your BTC, you finally can send it to any bitcoin casino of your preference. When you sign up on any online casino that supports BTC, they will provide you with your personal <span style="color: #ccffcc;"><span style="color: #00ffff;">BTC address</span>,</span> which you will use to send your funds to.</p>
