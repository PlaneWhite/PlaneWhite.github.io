				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong><span style="color: #808080;">UniBet Overview</span></strong></span></p>
<p>UniBet (<strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">$UBET</span></strong>) is a crypto gaming ecosystem that consists of multiple products; a gaming platform (released), a defi/staking platform (coming soon) and a futures derivative product (coming soon).  It is one of the few projects where prior to launching their token $UBET, they already had a working gaming platform which is something unusual in this space, since most projects that tend to launch on uniswap are filled with promises and barely deliver an actual product.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Features</span></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Gaming Platform</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Unibet&#8217;s first product is a fully working, crypto friendly<a href="https://burnt-games.net?ref=114"> gaming platform</a>  that features around 10 classical games such as: Dice, Video Poker, Baccarat, etc.<br />
What differentiates their platform from other competitors is the fact that they persistently reward their users. Users who join the platform are eligible to receive multiple bonuses. As soon as you sign up, you are rewarded with 100 free credits which you can use to test the platform&#8217;s functionalities. Furthermore other activities such as participating in the referral program, winning or even losing rewards players with credits, if a player loses more than 5000 credits (each 100 credit is worth 1USDT) they will get that same lost amount in $UBET tokens, since the team commits 5% of the house edge to buyback $UBET tokens.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-928 " src="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/p1.jpg" alt="" width="1153" height="670" srcset="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/p1.jpg 1640w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/p1-300x174.jpg 300w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/p1-768x446.jpg 768w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/p1-1024x595.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1153px) 100vw, 1153px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>Unibet Staking/Finance Platform</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Unibet plans to release a DeFI product, where users can stake their $UBET and generate attractive rewards based on the amount of $UBET staked. The platform will also evolve to include NFT achievements as rewards and a governance mechanism where holders of $UBET will be able to issue governance decisions by voting on future plans. This DeFI ecosystem will in turn attract more interest into the project. Every transaction will incur a 1% token Burn which will create a deflationary mechanism thus preserving the value of the token.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-934 " src="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_13-58-52-2.jpg" alt="" width="1182" height="588" srcset="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_13-58-52-2.jpg 1280w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_13-58-52-2-300x149.jpg 300w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_13-58-52-2-768x382.jpg 768w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_13-58-52-2-1024x510.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1182px) 100vw, 1182px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;"><strong>UniBit Futures</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p>UniBit Futures is an upcoming release where the team plans to build a cryptocurrency futures DEX, supporting up to 1000 cryptocurrencies. UniBit Futures allows investors<span class="ILfuVd"><span class="hgKElc"> to speculate on the <b>future</b> price of cryptocurrencies by using up to a 2x leverage. Users will be able to interact with the DEX directly from their metamask accounts. The compensation amount will be in $UBET tokens, and it will be fixed at 500$. Another advantage of this product is the zero fees for both deposits and withdrawals and zero commissions on your winnings or losses.</span></span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-932 " src="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_21-35-14.jpg" alt="" width="1110" height="1026" srcset="https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_21-35-14.jpg 1280w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_21-35-14-300x277.jpg 300w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_21-35-14-768x710.jpg 768w, https://bitgamble.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/photo_2020-09-30_21-35-14-1024x946.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1110px) 100vw, 1110px" /></p>

<p><span style="color: #666699;"><strong>Our Thoughts:</strong></span></p>
<p>UniBet&#8217;s vision and plan of actions are very captivating, we had a small chat with the owner of the project and he seems very enthusiastic for the success of his project, the initial aim of his project is to provide a platform where profit is shared among all users, winners and losers alike, which is something quite rare in the crypto gaming industry, few or even none of the already available competitors reward their users in a similar fashion in which UniBet plans to. Liquidity of the token is locked which can be verified <a href="https://unicrypt.network/uniswap-browser/pair/0x0fB987Bf19993783682E4e849184F4a56F0Ace6E">here</a></p>
<p>We are excited to observe how this project will evolve in the near future!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #808080;"><strong>Lync Network Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>Lync is an innovative deFI project that aims in creating a sustainable staking ecosystem with multiple other features that are soon to be released, such as Dapp Board games and NFT achievements. The lync network is composed of 3 core parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Token <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">$LYNC</span></strong></li>
<li>The Reward Pool</li>
<li>The Staking Mechanism</li>
</ol>
<p>You essentially stake your <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">$LYNC</span></strong> tokens and generate passive rewards that are derived from the reward pool. The staking mechanism is designed to maintain balance across the network, for example the reward pool feeds off of all transaction fees and staking penalties ( if you attempt to unstake your coins, you incur a flat fee of 5%). The reasoning behind the staking penalty is to discourage users to unstake their coins and direct-dump, in aims of preserving the token&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>The implementation of Board Game Dapps is another great addition that the team plans to release in their upcoming platform update, users will be able to compete against each other by playing <a href="https://bitgamble.org/what-are-provably-fair-games/">100% provably fair</a> dice based board games and users that rank in first place will earn their rewards in ETH/LYNC. In order to participate, players will have to pay <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">$LYNC</span></strong>, a small fee will be incurred on each entry which will go straight to the staking reward contract, thus supporting the token flow.</p>
<p>The team also has many other planned features to be released such as the addition of NFT achievements, more games and other exclusive content that is yet to be released somewhere in the future.</p>

<p>We are excited for Lync&#8217;s launch, they plan to lock 60% of the capital raised for liquidity which greatly promotes trust, and they also plan to publicize all team wallets and transactions to enhance transparency, which can be verified <a href="https://lync.network/tracking/">here</a>.  The team behind Lync are doing a great job in growing and maintaining their community, they are very responsive and  are willing to get feedback from the community to improve their vision. The link presales begins on the 28th September @ 5PM UTC</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #999999;">YFmoonShot &#8211; Is it another YF clone? </span><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;">YF Coins, the history</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p>YF coins&#8230; a movement that was first initiated by Yearn Finance, the original decentralized ecosystem for various DeFi products, where users can yield farm, earn passive income and generate native governance tokens. The tremendous success of Yearn Finance, lead to the creation of multiple other YF coins with similar properties which were not as successful but still insanely profitable. The latest Uniswap craze lead to the creation of more and more YF clones, where some completely mooned, such as YFBeta for example where it was selling for around 48$/coin in presale and peaked to around 2100$ that is nearly a 45X! However the popularity and profitability of YF Coins made it an attractive zone for scammers to step in. There were multiple YF coins that turned out to be complete scams, with ones not even reaching the Uniswap listing,  where scammers just ran away with the presale funds.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>YFmoonshot or YFMS inherits most properties from the popular YF coins, it aims to bring value, fairness and innovation to yield farming, however a key differentiator is the various burn mechanics built-in that will provide substantial price support in comparison to other tokens, It is a coin that is designed to have &#8216;permabull&#8217; fundamentals (hence the name YFmoonshot) by having very attractive tokenomics, and dis-incenitvizing users that unstake by burning 2.5% of their total staked coins, which rewards users that stake for longer periods of time and protects the value of $YFMS. The overall design mechanism of YFMS is made to preserve the value of coin by leveraging buyback and burn functions and preventing massive dumping of tokens onto the market.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Features:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Code is completely open sourced and audited</li>
<li>Permabull fundamentals, the coin has all the moon juice to vastly increase in price value</li>
<li>Professional &amp; active developers</li>
<li>DEV tokens will be locked prior to the presale, to promote trust and avoid any nefarious activity ( a percentage of them will unlock with each month that passe,)</li>
<li>Great Tokenomics</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Tokenomics of YFmoonshot:</strong></span><br />

<p>$YFMS is the governance token of the platform</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Our Thoughts:</strong></span></p>
<p>We are usually very skeptical when it comes to YF coins due to the immense number of recent rug pulls and scams that occurred in the Uniswap space. However YFmoonshot has really caught our eyes for a multitude of reasons, the project is original with very interesting fundamentals and definitely not a cheap YF copy, the team behind it appears to be very professional, they are putting lots of effort in the development of the project, the code speaks for itself.  Out of all the other legitimate YF coins that got released, YFmoonshot seems to have the most potential. On an another note, the way they designed their website is very creative, by using custom design and a Linux terminal as the general theme.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #999999;"><strong>Vybe Finance</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>Overview</strong></span></p>
<p>Vybe Finance is novel DeFI project that was launched on Uniswap without organizing any form of Presale, which is quite remarkable since most projects of similar scope rely purely on ICO offerings in order to survive and continue with the project&#8217;s vision &amp; development.</p>
<p>If you have been living under a rock for the past few months, and wondering what &#8216;DeFI&#8217; is, in a few words &#8216;DeFI&#8217; or Decentralized Finance is a transformational movement that utilizes blockchain technology to deal with financial services by eliminating intermediaries such banks or lawyers and instead use automated smart contracts.</p>
<p>Vybe is an emerging contributor to the DEFI ecosystem that proposes multiple financial solutions known as &#8216;melodies&#8217;. Currently there are 2 melodies available which can be used by holding <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>$VYBE</strong></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;">VybeStaking:</span> You can stake your Vybe and earn passive rewards ( at the moment of writing, you can expect at 2%-5% daily on your intial) The APY % is currently high which makes it remunerative to stake your coins especially since the coin is still new, the early bird gets the worm! However it is important to note that the reward percentages are never stable. On a second note, the total supply of Vybe is 2,000,000, currently there are no limits on stake rewards, however in the coming months the staking rate will be limited to 4% of the total Vybe supply ( starting next month) and stabilize at a final staking rate of 2% which is set to happen after 6 months.</li>
<li><span style="color: #00ff00;">VybeLoans:</span> By using VybeLoans which is a unique DaPP developed by Vybe you can lend or borrow loans without relying on any third party which is an integral part of DeFi, allowing borrowers and lenders to secure loans without any risk to both parties,  the process is made possible by using automated smart contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain, which are cryptographically secured and guaranteed. When the loan is paid back, 1% interest is earned and burned, contributing its value back to the Vybe ecosystem by increasing the value of each VYBE.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team has many more &#8216;melodies&#8217; and features planned in later releases, which will greatly expand Vybe&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #666699;"><strong>Our Thoughts:</strong></span></p>
<p>We are overall bullish on <strong><span style="color: #ff00ff;">$VYBE</span> </strong>for multiple reasons, the most interesting part of this project is that before even getting released it had 2 working products (Loans &amp; Staking), there were no fake promises or endless roadmaps with far fetched objectives.</p>
<p>This project was built completely from scratch by using original open source code and not relying on any investor funds, that is not something commonly seen in the Uniswap cyberspace. Furthermore the main dev is pseudo-anonymous publicly sharing his Linkedin profile and he seems very passionate about the growth and development of <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>$VYBE</strong></span>.</p>
<p>In addition, Liquidity on Uniswap is locked by the devs (around 50,000$), an essential step to be taken by any serious and transparent coin founder, any project that does not lock liquidity is a major red flag. The liquidity can be viewed <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x27c41e23b9ea6e8672ba205a8449f37f46a96e03">here</a></p>
<p>Currently Vybe can be traded on Uniswap or Fork Delta.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #666699;">Zdex Coin:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Presale has been successfully completed on September 9 2020, around 400 ETH were collected in under 5 minutes! which is quite impressive for a newly launched project.</p>
<p><span style="color: #999999;"><strong>Tokenomics of Zeedex:</strong></span><br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
10,000,000 &#8211; Total Supply<br />
&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>2,500,000 &#8211; Rewards (Incentives, Staking Rewards, etc)<br />
1,000,000 &#8211; Marketing and Growth<br />
2,000,000 &#8211; Reserve<br />
1,000,000 &#8211; Trade Competitions<br />
1,500,000 &#8211; Team  (Team tokens will be locked on a vesting schedule of 4 years, 25% release per year)<br />
2,000,000 &#8211; Presale</p>
<p>Holders of ZDEX will benefit from vastly reduced fees and many more perks that will be added in the near future. Since Zeedex has just launched  it is still extremely low-cap and given the historical performance of other DEX or even CEX coins, buying and holding ZDEX coins  for mid-long term period of time might grant a decent return on your investment, especially taking into consideration the bullishness of exchange coins such as BNB, KCS or any other popular exchange tokens, that increased vastly in value. At the moment, you can buy ZDEX coins via Uniswap.</p>
<p><span style="color: #666699; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Our Thoughts:</strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://zeedex.io">Zeedex.io</a> is an interesting DEX project that has much potential, it aims to be DeFI hub in the cryptocurrency cyberspace. We will be keeping our eyes on this project and track how it will progress in this competitive industry, Zeedex is is still in its very early stages and it is difficult to provide a full analysis, however it is worth noting that it is headed by an ambitious team and it is exciting to see how they will lead and evolve this project.</p>
